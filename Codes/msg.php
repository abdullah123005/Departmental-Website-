<p>
 On behalf of the faculty and staff, I want to encourage you to participate in this department.
 Although your first concern is your own academic success, you have a role to play in moving the department ahead.
 You are expected to be a good citizen and exhibit the highest standards of academic and professional integrity.
 Many opportunities will arise for you to represent this department and the university: do so with distinction.
You will find that other students can benefit from your knowledge, skills and leadership. Look for ways to serve others in the department.
